>
> Trump: I don't think I had... I mean, I'm not involved. I never went to his island, fortunately. But a lot of people did.
>
> Lex Fridman: Why do you think so many smart, powerful people allowed him to get so close?
>
> Trump: He was a good salesman. He was a hailing hardy type of guy. He had some nice assets that he'd throw around like islands. But a lot of big people went to that island. But fortunately I was not one of them.
>
> Lex Fridman: It's just very strange for a lot of peple that the list of clients that went to the island has not been made public.
>
> Trump: Yeah, it's very interesting isn't it? Probably will be by the way. Probably.
>
> Lex Fridman: So if you are able to, you'll be...
>
> Trump: I'd certainly take a look at it.
>
> Now, Kennedy's interesting 'cause it's so many years ago. You know, they do that for danger too, because you know, endangers certain people, et cetera. So Kennedy is very different from the Epstein thing.

> Benny Johnson: I saw you make news this morning about that. I gotta get to that. You say that the FBI has Epstein's list. They're sitting on it. That doesn't seem like something you should do. You're protecting the world's foremost predator. That seems like an evil thing to do regardless of who may be embarrassed in the release of that list. **Why is the FBI protecting the greatest pederast, the largest-scale pederast in human history?**
>
> Kash Patel: **Simple, because of who's on that list. You don't think that Bill Gates is lobbying Congress night and day to prevent the disclosure of that list? ... Put on your big boy pants and let us know who the pedophiles are.** We have an election coming up and we need to adjudicate this matter at the polls.

### July 8 --- Trump Criticizes Reporter's Questin Re: Epstein Memo 📰

The reporter asked: “Your memo and the release yesterday [about] Jeffrey Epstein, it left some lingering mysteries. One of the biggest ones is whether he ever worked for a [sic] American foreign intelligence agency… the former Labor Secretary who was Miami U.S. Attorney [Alex Acosta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Acosta) allegedly said that he did work for an intelligence agency, so could you resolve whether or not he did and also could you say why there was a minute missing from the jail house tape on the night of death?”

The question was directed at Bondi, but Trump interrupted with:

> Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? This guy’s been talked about for years. You’re asking—we have Texas, we have this, we have all of the things. And are people still talking about this guy, this creep? That is unbelievable… I mean, I can’t believe you’re asking a question on Epstein at a time like this where we’re having some of the greatest success and also tragedy with what happened in Texas. It just seems like a desecration. [YouTube --- FOX 4 Dallas-Fort Worth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE-b4_QkF64)

### July 11 --- Wired Reports DOJ Video "Likely Modified" According to Metadata 📰

> Metadata embedded in the video and analyzed by WIRED and independent video forensics experts shows that rather than being a direct export from the prison’s surveillance system, the footage was modified, likely using the professional editing tool Adobe Premiere Pro. The file appears to have been assembled from at least two source clips, saved multiple times, exported, and then uploaded to the DOJ’s website, where it was presented as “raw” footage.

### July 12 --- Trump Frustrated About Epstein Files Pressure 💻

Trump posted his frustrated on Truth Social:

> What’s going on with my “boys” and, in some cases, “gals?” They’re all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! We’re on one Team, MAGA, and I don’t like what’s happening. We have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and “selfish people” are trying to hurt it, all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein. **For years, it’s Epstein, over and over again. Why are we giving publicity to Files written by Obama, Crooked Hillary, Comey, Brennan, and the Losers and Criminals of the Biden Administration, who conned the World with the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, 51 “Intelligence” Agents, “THE LAPTOP FROM HELL,” and more? They created the Epstein Files, just like they created the FAKE Hillary Clinton/Christopher Steele Dossier that they used on me, and now my so-called “friends” are playing right into their hands. Why didn’t these Radical Left Lunatics release the Epstein Files? If there was ANYTHING in there that could have hurt the MAGA Movement, why didn’t they use it?** They haven’t even given up on the John F. Kennedy or Martin Luther King, Jr. Files. No matter how much success we have had, securing the Border, deporting Criminals, fixing the Economy, Energy Dominance, a Safer World where Iran will not have Nuclear Weapons, it’s never enough for some people. We are about to achieve more in 6 months than any other Administration has achieved in over 100 years, and we have so much more to do. We are saving our Country and, MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, which will continue to be our complete PRIORITY. The Left is imploding! Kash Patel, and the FBI, must be focused on investigating Voter Fraud, Political Corruption, ActBlue, The Rigged and Stolen Election of 2020, and arresting Thugs and Criminals, instead of spending month after month looking at nothing but the same old, Radical Left inspired Documents on Jeffrey Epstein. LET PAM BONDI DO HER JOB — SHE’S GREAT! The 2020 Election was Rigged and Stolen, and they tried to do the same thing in 2024 — That’s what she is looking into as AG, and much more. One year ago our Country was DEAD, now it’s the “HOTTEST” Country anywhere in the World. Let’s keep it that way, and not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about. Thank you for your attention to this matter! [Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114842356238631061)
